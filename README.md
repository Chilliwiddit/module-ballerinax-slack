[Slack](https://api.slack.com/) is a channel-based messaging platform. With Slack, people can work together more effectively, connect all their software tools and services, and find the information they need to do their best work â€” all within a secure, enterprise-grade environment.

This connector allows you to access the Slack Web API and Slack Events API through Ballerina.
It provides the capability to query information from and perform some actions in a Slack workspace.

For more information, go to the modules.
